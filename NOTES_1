🏪 ShopVerse — Explained Simply

Imagine you’re shopping online — like on Amazon.
ShopVerse is the backend system (the part you don’t see) that makes that whole experience work —
from signing up to paying for an order, to getting notifications — all automatically, reliably, and fast.

But unlike a single big program, ShopVerse is built from many small independent parts called microservices.
Each service does one job really well, and they all talk to each other through Kafka, a kind of internal messenger.

🧩 The Big Picture

Here’s what happens when you use ShopVerse:

You create an account or log in.

You browse or search for products.

You add something to your cart and place an order.

The system processes payment.

You get a notification that your order was placed or paid.

Behind the scenes, different services handle each part — and they all work together automatically.

💁‍♀️ Each Service Explained in Plain English
1️⃣ API Gateway – The Front Door

Think of it as the security guard + receptionist of the whole system.
Every request (login, order, product search, etc.) goes through the Gateway.

Checks if you’re allowed in (validates your login token — like your ID card).

Limits how many times you can make requests per minute (to stop spammers).

Sends your request to the right department (service).

🛠 Tech: Spring Cloud Gateway + Redis Rate Limiter + JWT Authentication

2️⃣ User Service – Handles Accounts

This is the HR department — it knows who you are.

Lets you register or log in.

Stores user info (like name, email, password) safely in a PostgreSQL database.

When you log in, it gives you a JWT token (a digital pass you use to prove who you are).

🛠 Tech: Spring Boot + PostgreSQL + Spring Security + JWT

3️⃣ Product Service – Manages All Products

This is the inventory & search team.

Keeps product data in a MongoDB database (great for flexible info like descriptions or images).

Uses ElasticSearch to make searching fast and smart (e.g., fuzzy matches like “iphon” → “iPhone”).

Uses Redis to cache popular products so they load instantly (like a quick memory).

🛠 Tech: MongoDB + ElasticSearch + Redis

4️⃣ Order Service – Takes Your Orders

This is the order desk.

When you click “Place Order,” it checks if the user and product are valid.

Saves the order details in PostgreSQL (status = “PENDING”).

Then it sends a message to Kafka — “A new order was created” — so other services can react (like payment or notifications).

🛠 Tech: PostgreSQL + Kafka (producer)

5️⃣ Payment Service – Handles Payments (Async)

This is the finance department.

It listens for new order messages from Kafka.

Pretends to contact a payment gateway (like a bank or PayPal) to “process” payment.

Sends back another message — “Payment successful” or “Payment failed.”

Updates the Order Service when payment status changes.

🛠 Tech: Kafka (consumer) + REST calls

💡 Async = faster: The user doesn’t have to wait for payment to finish — the system continues in background.

6️⃣ Notification Service – Sends Alerts

This is the customer service / email team.

Listens to Kafka messages about new orders or payments.

Sends notifications like:

“Your order has been placed!”

“Your payment was successful.”

“Payment failed, please try again.”

Even if the payment service is slow, this service still runs independently.

🛠 Tech: Kafka (consumer) + Logging / mock notifications

7️⃣ Redis – The Speed Booster

This is the system’s memory.

Keeps copies of frequently accessed data (like popular products).

Saves time — instead of going to the database every time, it can serve from memory.

Also helps limit requests at the Gateway (so one user can’t overload the system).

🛠 Tech: Redis

8️⃣ Resilience4J – The Safety Net

Think of this as shock absorbers for the system.

If one service (like payment) is slow or down, others don’t crash — they wait or skip it gracefully.

Uses “circuit breakers” to stop calling broken services repeatedly.

🛠 Tech: Resilience4J

9️⃣ Docker & Docker Compose – The Builder

This is the packing & deployment tool.

Each service is put inside a “container” (like a mini computer that runs anywhere).

docker-compose starts all services (DBs, Kafka, Redis, etc.) with one command.

🛠 Tech: Docker + Docker Compose

🔟 GitHub Actions & AWS – The DevOps Pipeline

This is the automation team.

Every time you push code to GitHub:

It automatically builds & tests everything.

Optionally deploys to AWS EC2 (a free cloud server).

So the system can go live online without manual setup.

🛠 Tech: GitHub Actions + AWS EC2 + CI/CD

1️⃣1️⃣ Monitoring & Observability – The Health Dashboard

This is the control room.

Collects system metrics (CPU, requests, memory).

Shows dashboards so you can see what’s happening in real time.

Helps detect slowdowns or crashes early.

🛠 Tech: Prometheus + Grafana + Spring Actuator

🚀 End-to-End Example (How It All Works Together)

You log in → User Service gives you a token.

You browse products → Product Service (with Redis cache + ElasticSearch).

You place an order → Order Service saves it & sends a Kafka message.

Payment Service picks up the message → processes payment → sends new Kafka message.

Notification Service reads the message → sends “Payment successful!”

Everything runs in Docker → monitored with Grafana → deployed on AWS.

🧠 In Short
Step	What Happens	Who Handles It
Signup/Login	Create account, get JWT	User Service
Browse/Search	View products	Product Service
Place Order	Store order, trigger events	Order Service
Payment	Process payment async	Payment Service
Notify	Send success/failure messages	Notification Service
Cache & Rate Limit	Faster reads & safer system	Redis
Monitor & Deploy	CI/CD, metrics, dashboards	GitHub Actions + AWS + Grafana
🌟 Simple Analogy

🏠 Think of ShopVerse like a well-organized shopping mall:

Gateway = security + reception

User Service = registration desk

Product Service = display section

Order Service = billing counter

Payment Service = bank counter

Notification Service = message desk

Redis = quick memory to speed things up

Kafka = internal walkie-talkie system connecting all departments

Docker & AWS = the building that hosts the mall

Prometheus & Grafana = CCTV monitoring room
